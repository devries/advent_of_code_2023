## Plan for This Year

This year I am going to try a couple of new things. First, I am going to try to
use the delve go debugger rather than put in print statements while I debug. My
hope is that by the end of December I will be much more familiar with the
debugger. Second, I want to try asking some generative AIs for helpful functions
to see how it improves my speed. I was considering Github copilot, but I just
can't give up my current editor, [helix](https://helix-editor.com/), to use
vscode, and I don't really want to go down that neovim plugin rabbit hole
anymore. 

I may use codespaces a bit. I've added some permissions so that I can clone my
private inputs submodule just in case, but it's hard to beat the setup I use to
write code every day.

This year I also created a new Advent of Code template in the
[devries/aoc_template](https://github.com/devries/aoc_template) repository. It
compiles everything into a single executable and times how long it takes to run
each problem, as well as generates a template for each day. It was also an
opportunity to experiment a bit with code generation.

## Solutions

No problems until December 1st. Good luck everyone!
